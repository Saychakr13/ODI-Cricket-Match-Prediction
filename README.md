# ODI-Cricket-Match-Prediction

<h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
<p>
With the advent of statistical modeling in sports, predicting the outcome of a game has been established as a fundamental problem. Cricket is one of the most popular team games in the world. Moreover cricket betting is a multi-billion dollar market. Therefore, there is a strong incentive for models that can predict the outcomes of games and beat the odds provided by bookers. The aim of this study is to investigate to what degree it is possible to predict the outcome of cricket matches.<br>
Cricket matches are quite unpredictable. Considering only ODI matches, we will try to predict who is going to be the winner of the match, before the match begins. 
Suppose we know that there is going to be an ODI match between Team A and Team B in near future. Before the match begins, our ML model should predict which team will win the match.
